# Framework Details

The UI framework is built on Playwright and JavaScript, focusing on minimal configuration requirements for additional functionalities such as reporting and more.

## Page Object Model

I am a proponent of the Page Object Model due to its strengths in maintainability, reusability, and readability. This model advocates for a clear separation between page navigation/operations and the test scripts themselves. By defining elements and functions within page objects, it enables their reuse across various test scripts, thereby minimizing code duplication.

## config.js
 
 Centralizing application URLs in a config.js file simplifies their management and updates. This approach facilitates seamless environment switching, such as transitioning from staging to production, with modifications confined to a single file, thus centralizing configuration management.

Additionally, it supports the dynamic selection of URLs through environment variables, enabling the execution of tests across various environments without altering the codebase.

Furthermore, this strategy segregates configuration data from test logic, aligning with best practices in software development.

## Structuring Tests and Pages
 
 Organizing test scripts and page objects into separate folders enhances the codebase's structure. This arrangement intuitively delineates the locations for test scripts and page-specific methods and properties, making them readily identifiable.

As the test suite expands, this setup facilitates easier navigation, management, and scalability of the tests.

# playwright.config.js
 
 Leveraging playwright.config.js for browser configurations and reporting centralizes Playwright settings, which aids in facilitating cross-browser testing efficiently.

 Html report will be generated in 'playwright-report' folder and JSON report under 'reports' folder.
